Assignment 1 README Assignment Description: 
The assignment involves implementing a Perceptron Learning Algorithm and evaluating its performance on a given dataset. 
The dataset consists of features and labels stored in a text file named train.txt. 
The Perceptron algorithm is trained on the features to predict the labels, and accuracy is calculated using the predicted labels against the ground truth labels. 
Implementation Steps: Read the dataset from the train.txt file. 
Preprocess the data by splitting it into features and labels. 
Normalize the features using Min-Max scaling. 
Implement the Perceptron class with methods for training and prediction. 
Train the Perceptron algorithm on the normalized features. 
Calculate accuracy using the trained model. 
Save the weights of the trained model to a text file for future use. 
Usage: Clone the repository containing the code. 
Ensure that the train.txt file is in the same directory as the code. 
Run the Python script to execute the Perceptron algorithm and evaluate accuracy. 

Assignment 2 README Assignment Description: 
This assignment focuses on implementing Eigenfaces for face recognition using a classifier such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). 
The task involves preprocessing face image data, training a classifier on the transformed data, and evaluating its performance. 
Implementation Steps: Read the face image data from a dataset. 
Preprocess the images and extract features.
Visualize Eigenfaces to understand the principal components. 
Choose a classifier (e.g., KNN) and train it on the transformed data. 
Make predictions on the testing data using the trained classifier. 
Calculate accuracy and construct a confusion matrix to evaluate performance. 
Experiment with different values of n_components in PCA and observe the impact on accuracy. 
Visualize a subset of Eigenfaces and report observations on model performance. 
Usage:  Clone the repository containing the code. Ensure that the face image dataset is available in the specified format. 
        Run the Python script to execute Eigenfaces preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps.
